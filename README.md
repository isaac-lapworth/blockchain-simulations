# About
University coursework focusing on blockchain consensus mechanisms. Includes multithreaded simulations of Bitcoin's proof-of-work and NEO's distributed Byzantine fault-tolerance (dBFT) protocols.

Written and tested on Windows using Visual Studio Community 2017. Please note there is some code duplication between the simulations because they were developed as separate projects.
